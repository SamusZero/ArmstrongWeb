  <a href="#"><h1>About Me</h1><p>My name is Roderick Armstrong, and for as long as I can 
    remember I've always wanted to code. For years I would looked over programming languages,
    and reviewed content I didn't understand. I later helped build websites
    through Dreamweaver, and made attemps to use javascript. My tech career is still 
    in its infantcy, but through this program, I seek to make it a lifestyle.</p>
    <div class="about me"><p>Besides the interest in programming and technology, I have a 
        large list of interest from photography to filmaking, and I love spartan races. 
        The obstacle course racing changed my life in the most amazing way.
    These races teach you, that no matter how hard it is, you gotta keep on trying
till you cross the finishline. </p></div>
